## 📌 Topic Overview
The **Online Quiz App** is a console-based Java application that allows users to attempt a multiple-choice quiz.  
It displays each question with four options, accepts the user’s answer, checks correctness, and shows the final score.  
This project demonstrates **Java programming basics**, **control structures**, **collections**, and **object-oriented concepts**.
